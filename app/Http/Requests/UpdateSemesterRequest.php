     *
     *          Abbreviation/Description:
     *              required        - Data must be present
     *              min             - Minimum length of 1 character is required.
     *              unique          - Field must be unique (e.g. two abbreviations cannot match). The unique clause
     *                                checks the database (ignoring case) to ensure abbreviations are unique.
     *
     *          Room:
     *              required        - Data must be present
     *              alpha_dash      - Entry can be alpha-numeric, including dashes and underscores
     *
     *          Building_ID:
     *              required        - Data mush be present sent the entry is a foreign key linking back to the Buildings
     *                                table
     *              integer         - Only integer values are acceptable
     *
     *          Default_Selection:
     *              integer         -
     *              min             - Minimum value of zero is allowed, but nothing less than zero. 0 = OFF or NOT
     *                                SELECTED
     *              max             - Maximum value of one is allowed, but no greater. 1 = ON or SELECTED
     *
     * @todo should additional logic be included for validating start_date relative to end_date?
     * @todo is the curly brace in the abbreviation rule a typo?
     *
     * @return array Array of validation rules that will be used to validate incoming data.
